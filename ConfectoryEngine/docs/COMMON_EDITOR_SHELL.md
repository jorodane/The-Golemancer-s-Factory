# Common editor shell migration

## Active task and resume instructions

The active authorized task is the complete common engine-pack UI migration,
not the earlier repository synchronization request. On resuming after context
compression, read this document and inspect existing changes before proceeding.
Preserve unfinished changes. Do not report a synchronization result or a partial
checkpoint as completion of this task.

The user confirmed that all engine-pack elements remain identical and are
interpreted differently only by platform adapters, and authorized ordinary main
pushes. Preserve existing functionality, locality, consent and private state.
No force push, generated binaries, images, logs or secrets may enter Git.
External AI/authentication flows must use test doubles unless explicitly
authorized; do not transmit secrets or initiate paid requests for verification.

Completion requires every flow in the matrix below, platform rendering/input
adapters, regression checks and remote CI, actual Linux screen/input flows,
final exact remote main SHA, and an executable package delivered through Library.
Report source/reference compilation separately from desktop/device execution.

Current next checkpoint: pack-owned startup motion and home branding. The recent
project checkpoint is published as f20337b404fdff3f2244eaaf5bae6b03a84c7f63;
all five remote CI jobs passed in run 37183768783. Uncommitted StudioMotion,
trusted Shell metadata, home brand view and native animation/frame adapters have
passed local verification; publish this checkpoint and check remote CI. Continue Agent connection/model/Helper management next, then
workspace, conversations, collaboration, pack management and granular review.
Do not mistake this checkpoint for completion of the overall task.

All three editor hosts must mount the same installed engine pack elements and
invoke the same shared actions. Native adapters own drawing, input, measurement,
frame scheduling, file pickers and credential storage, not alternate workflows.
Project packs cannot replace the trusted shell or access credentials.

## Acceptance matrix

| Flow | Existing behavior to preserve | Migration status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup | vector logo, staged entrance, logo flight to home, Connect/Later, saved Agent skip | pack presentation, trusted motion, saved-identity state and home branding shared; local verification passed |
| Agents | provider/auth/model/profile selection, restore, enabled state, private credentials | pending |
| Helpers | avatar/character/memories, Main Helper and worker roles | creation and MAIN selection shared within project creation; profiles pending |
| Project home | recent cards, icons, rename/delete, last opened | shared cards/actions in progress; branding/motion pending |
| Creation | name/icon/description/path, Main Agent/Helpers | shared controller and pack view mounted; portable and SDL input verified |
| Workspace | independent project surface, role characters, movable panels and persisted layout | pending |
| Conversation | send/stream/cancel/history/context, reviewed changes, no automatic requests on open | pending |
| Collaboration | Agent–Worker–Helper, YogiBox, participants/inbox/control/handoffs | pending |
| Packs | create/inherit/implementation/enable, plugins/global packs/import/export | pending |
| Review | individual selection, conflicts, consent and histories | pending |

## Implementation order

1. Add a trusted, declarative shell view to the existing installed CoreTools pack;
   mount it before project execution in Windows, Android and Linux. Extend native
   renderer contracts for pack-owned vector geometry and presentation.
2. Move device directory and project catalog state/actions into shared controllers;
   mount pack-owned Agent, Helper, home and creation views in all hosts.
3. Move conversation, collaboration, authoring, review and window state into
   shared controllers, keeping project queries owner-local and cross-pack queries
   explicit. Remove superseded native screen constructors only after regression
   coverage demonstrates their replacement.
4. Check engine isolation and the selected consumer campaign at each published
   checkpoint. Final verification includes remote CI and actual desktop/device
   flows, with source compilation reported separately from native execution.

This document tracks work in progress. A startup checkpoint is not full parity.

## Checkpoint evidence

`6610c0a72eeddede3d6033cfaab024b6376705eb` publishes shared project creation
and fixes the startup wrapping/button-chrome regression. All five remote CI jobs
passed in run 37181292883, independently confirmed by the parent. This is partial
progress, not completion of the acceptance matrix.

`6774d0da7227594092a9d6c7ce11a59281347491` mounts the common startup
presentation on all three hosts. Local native SDL and portable verification passed.
Its remote Windows startup check caught wrapping/button-chrome regressions;
`wrapText`, font weight and pack-authored button states address that regression in
this next checkpoint without weakening the original native assertion.

Project creation is now driven by `EditorStudioProjectCreation` and the installed
`editor.studio.new-project` view. Native hosts supply file/folder pickers, UI thread
scheduling and activation callbacks. Agent/Helper choice, Helper creation, MAIN
selection, validation and metadata writes are shared. Portable tests exercise all
three platform contracts, preserve entered values through role changes, reject
relative paths and existing output, and exclude private Agent state from manifests.
The actual SDL smoke creates a Korean-named project through pointer/text input.

The recent-project checkpoint mounts the same pack-authored two-column grid,
new-project tile and project card templates on every host. The common controller
owns draft/committed rename, catalog metadata, guarded OS callbacks and reversible
delete confirmation/cancellation. Obsolete native card workflows were removed.
Portable checks cover all three contracts; actual SDL text/Enter/pointer flows
cover inline rename and delete cancellation. Windows and Android source/reference
compilation passed; desktop/device execution remains a separate CI/device check.

The home checkpoint f20337b uses 358 pack checks, native SDL flows, source/reference
adapter compilation and the complete external consumer campaign. Its Windows,
Linux native, portable, Android and engine compatibility CI jobs all passed.

Startup motion/home brand checkpoint evidence: engine isolation, Studio 225,
authoring 39, full external consumer campaign, and pack 369/live-view 88 checks
passed. Windows and Android adapters were rebuilt without incremental outputs;
actual Linux SDL verified blank inert first frame, cubic entrance, keyboard
Connect/Later, three-element flight, input restoration and saved-Agent automatic
home entry. No external AI/auth request was performed. Phase screenshots are
kept outside Git under /workspace/scratch/studio-motion-final.png.{startup,home}.png.
Linux still has a legacy toolbar/manual project surface; Agent connection currently
still uses the unfinished placeholder callback and must be replaced before final
delivery. Full shell parity and Library package delivery remain unfinished.

Resume next: implement the common Agent connection/model workflow and secure
write-only password renderer, preserving Codex install/login consent and encrypted
OS credential stores. Drafts are in /tmp/StudioAgentConnection.cs,
/tmp/StudioAgentService.cs, /tmp/agent-ui.xml and /tmp/agent-secret.py; these are
not applied or verified and must be reviewed before use. Prefer model-choice
command indexes over remote model IDs. Stage providers until identity/credential
persistence succeeds; dispose unadopted providers on failure/cancellation.
